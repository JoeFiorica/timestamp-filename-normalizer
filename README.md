# timestamp-filename-normalizer
A Python tool that normalizes MP4 filenames by extracting datestamps from legacy formats or from each video’s associated raw data folder. Supports wildcard matching, validates naming against a consistent SYYYYEMMDD – Title.mp4 standard, and ensures clean, sortable, chronologically accurate media libraries.
